# Invite
The easiest way to use the bot is to [invite](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1108279646165942363&scope=bot&permissions=1099511655488) it to your server. After the bot has joined your server, you can start configuring it! For that, you can [visit](/commands/commands) the page for all the commands. There is also a starter guide with all the neccessary changes you _should_ do.
